					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">I started my education in Tadika Sinar Pintar which located just 15 minutes away from my home. I can still remember vividly when my father will send me off to the kindergarten using his motorcycle every morning before he gone to his work. </p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">Follow up to the next stage, I have been entered to a private primary school, Sekolah Rendah Islam Hira. At there I have been introduced with so many things regarding Islam as the school is practicing Islamic culture and environment in total. Every morning, I will join tadarrus and hafazan Al-Quran before the classes start. There are many other practices that are good because it will briefly introduce the students about Islam since they are younger.</p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">After UPSR, I have entered Sekolah Agama Menengah Tinggi Sultan Hishamuddin where I study and take my PT3, as I am the second batch of PT3 candidates. Receiving a good result for my PT3 I applied both MRSM and SBP because I want to experience different environment in different school. Lucky for me, I have got into both MRSM Kuala Krai, Kelantan and Kolej Islan Sultan Alam Shah (KISAS). After long thought, I decided to enter <a href="https://m.facebook.com/pages/category/Religious-School/Kolej-Islam-Sultan-Alam-Shah-Official-191199154273963/" target="self">KISAS</a> as it location is more near with my home rather than MRSM which located in Kelantan. Again, I have entered one of the prestigious SBP which is an Islamic school. There, I learned so many things besides my academic. I have learned about Biah Solehah, ukhuwah, and other Islamic matters in detail. I also noticed that I should level up my effort in studies in science streams class as all the students there are really smart, and the competition is always intense when it comes to academical matter. However, despites being stress out in my study, I know that I love the environment there because I will be touched whenever I recall all the memories created in that time. </p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">To continue, I have planned to further my study in other field beside science streams because I thought that I could not continue with it anymore. Enough with all of sciences during my SPM. That is why I have chosen Diploma of Library Management in Universiti Teknologi MARA as my first choice eventhough I do not even know what I will learn throughout the semesters. Alhamdulillah, I still can bear with all the courses of this fourth and final semester even the number of assignments is really hold me back.</p>
					<p style = "text-indent : 3em;">So, what will I choose for my degree soon? I do not know. We will wait and see.</p>
